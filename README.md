# 🚀 Simple Blockchain in Java

This project is a basic **Blockchain** implementation in Java. It demonstrates how a blockchain works by using cryptographic hashing, linking blocks, proof-of-work mining, and blockchain validation.

---

## 🏗 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java ☕  
- **Hashing Algorithm:** SHA-256 🔐  
- **Data Structures:** ArrayList 📦  
- **Development Environment:** VS Code / Eclipse / IntelliJ IDEA 🖥  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub 🛠  

---

## 📌 Features
- 📦 **Blocks**: Each block contains data, a hash, a timestamp, and the previous block's hash.
- 🔐 **SHA-256 Hashing**: Used to generate digital fingerprints for each block.
- ⛏ **Proof of Work (Mining)**: Blocks require computational work to be added to the blockchain.
- 🔗 **Chain Validation**: Ensures the integrity of the blockchain.
- 📜 **Genesis Block**: The first block in the chain.
